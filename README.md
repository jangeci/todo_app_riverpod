TODO app with riverpod state management, Firebase authentication and Firestore database as backend. Changes on tasks are reflected in realtime, pagination per 10items, task can be shared. Once logged in user opens deeplink task will be asigned to him. Firestore have some limitations regarding queries so i used 2 lists, one for todos where logged in user is owner and one list for taks shared with him. 
Didnt do registration so only already existing test users can interact with it.
